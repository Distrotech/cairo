{"name":"Cairo","tagline":"Mirror of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/cairo","body":"Cairo - Multi-platform 2D graphics library\r\nhttp://cairographics.org\r\n\r\nWhat is cairo\r\n=============\r\nCairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output\r\ndevices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window\r\nSystem (via both Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers,\r\nas well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG file output. Experimental backends\r\ninclude OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.\r\n\r\nCairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media\r\nwhile taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available\r\n(for example, through the X Render Extension).\r\n\r\nThe cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of\r\nPostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling\r\ncubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images,\r\nand antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be\r\ntransformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nCairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern\r\n2D graphical user interface.  At the same time, the cairo API has been\r\ndesigned to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you're not\r\nhaving fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed\r\nsomewhere---let us know and we'll try to fix it next time around.\r\n\r\nCairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or\r\nmodified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version\r\n1.1.\r\n\r\nWhere to get more information about cairo\r\n=========================================\r\nThe primary source of information about cairo is:\r\n\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/\r\n\r\nThe latest versions of cairo can always be found at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/download\r\n\r\nDocumentation on using cairo and frequently-asked questions:\r\n\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/documentation\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/FAQ\r\n\r\nMailing lists for contacting cairo users and developers:\r\n\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/lists\r\n\r\nRoadmap and unscheduled things to do, (please feel free to help out):\r\n\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/roadmap\r\n\thttp://cairographics.org/todo\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\nThe set of libraries needed to compile cairo depends on which backends\r\nare enabled when cairo is configured. So look at the list below to\r\ndetermine which dependencies are needed for the backends of interest.\r\n\r\nFor the surface backends, we have both \"supported\" and \"experimental\"\r\nbackends. Further, the supported backends can be divided into the\r\n\"standard\" backends which can be easily built on any platform, and the\r\n\"platform\" backends which depend on some underlying platform-specific\r\nsystem, (such as the X Window System or some other window system).\r\n\r\nAs an example, for a standard Linux build, (with image, png, pdf,\r\nPostScript, svg, and xlib surface backends, and the freetype font\r\nbackend), the following sample commands will install necessary\r\ndependencies:\r\n\r\n    Debian (and similar):\r\n\r\n\tapt-get install libpng12-dev libz-dev libxrender-dev libfontconfig1-dev\r\n\r\n    Fedora (and similar):\r\n\r\n\tyum install libpng-devel zlib-devel libXrender-devel fontconfig-devel\r\n\r\n(Those commands intentionally don't install pixman from a distribution\r\npackage since if you're manually compiling cairo, then you likely want\r\nto grab pixman from the same place at the same time and compile it as\r\nwell.)\r\n\r\nSupported, \"standard\" surface backends\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\timage backend (required)\r\n\t------------------------\r\n\tpixman >= 0.20.2\thttp://cairographics.org/releases\r\n\r\n\tpng support (can be left out if desired, but many\r\n\t-----------  applications expect it to be present)\r\n\tlibpng\t\t\thttp://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html\r\n\r\n\tpdf backend\r\n\t-----------\r\n\tzlib\t\t\thttp://www.gzip.org/zlib\r\n\r\n\tpostscript backend\r\n\t------------------\r\n\tzlib\t\t\thttp://www.gzip.org/zlib\r\n\r\n\tsvg backend\r\n\t-----------\r\n\t[none]\r\n\r\nSupported, \"platform\" surface backends\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\txlib backend\r\n\t------------\r\n\tX11\t\t\thttp://freedesktop.org/Software/xlibs\r\n\r\n\txlib-xrender backend\r\n\t--------------------\r\n\tXrender >= 0.6\t\thttp://freedesktop.org/Software/xlibs\r\n\r\n\tquartz backend\r\n\t--------------\r\n\tMacOS X >= 10.4 with Xcode >= 2.4\r\n\r\n\twin32 backend\r\n\t-------------\r\n\tMicrosoft Windows 2000 or newer[*].\r\n\r\n\txcb backend\r\n\t-----------\r\n\tXCB\t\t\thttp://xcb.freedesktop.org\r\n\r\nFont backends (required to have at least one)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\tfreetype font backend\r\n\t---------------------\r\n\tfreetype >= 2.1.9\thttp://freetype.org\r\n\tfontconfig\t\thttp://fontconfig.org\r\n\r\n\tquartz-font backend\r\n\t-------------------\r\n\tMacOS X >= 10.4 with Xcode >= 2.4\r\n\r\n\twin32 font backend\r\n\t------------------\r\n\tMicrosoft Windows 2000 or newer[*].\r\n\r\n\t[*] The Win32 backend should work on Windows 2000 and newer\r\n\t    (excluding Windows Me.) Most testing has been done on\r\n\t    Windows XP. While some portions of the code have been\r\n\t    adapted to work on older versions of Windows, considerable\r\n\t    work still needs to be done to get cairo running in those\r\n\t    environments.\r\n\r\n\t    Cairo can be compiled on Windows with either the gcc\r\n\t    toolchain (see http://www.mingw.org) or with Microsoft\r\n\t    Visual C++.  If the gcc toolchain is used, the standard\r\n\t    build instructions using configure apply, (see INSTALL).\r\n\t    If Visual C++ is desired, GNU make is required and\r\n\t    Makefile.win32 can be used via 'make -f Makefile.win32'.\r\n\t    The compiler, include paths, and library paths must be set\r\n\t    up correctly in the environment.\r\n\r\n\t    MSVC versions earlier than 7.1 are known to miscompile\r\n\t    parts of cairo and pixman, and so should be avoided. MSVC\r\n\t    7.1 or later, including the free Microsoft Visual Studio\r\n\t    Express editions, produce correct code.\r\n\r\nExperimental surface backends\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\tbeos backend\r\n\t------------\r\n\tNo dependencies in itself other than an installed BeOS system, but cairo\r\n\trequires a font backend. See the freetype dependency list.\r\n\r\n\tos2 backend\r\n\t-----------\r\n\tCairo should run on any recent version of OS/2 or eComStation, but it\r\n\trequires a font backend. See the freetype dependency list. Ready to use\r\n\tpackages and developer dependencies are available at Netlabs:\r\n\t\t\t\tftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/cairo\r\n\r\nCompiling\r\n=========\r\nSee the INSTALL document for build instructions.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\nCairo was originally developed by Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org> and\r\nKeith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>. Many thanks are due to Lyle Ramshaw\r\nwithout whose patient help our ignorance would be much more apparent.\r\n\r\nSince the original development, many more people have contributed to\r\ncairo. See the AUTHORS files for as complete a list as we've been able\r\nto compile so far.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
